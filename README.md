# Countdown Page

Literally just a page with a countdown.

## Why?

I have upcoming trips, and I wanted to see a countdown until my trip dates every time I open a new tab on Chrome.

## Usage

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/b-ggs/countdown-page.git
```

Modify `script.js`, and add your own countdown with the following format.

```
newCountdown("any-class-name", "until my trip!", moment("December 25, 2017"));
```

Open `index.html`, or set it as your default New Tab page on your browser like I did.

## Things I used:

 * jQuery
 * moment.js
 * countdown.js
